# Instructions for the random walker scipt:

The random walker creates a random path for a number of steps and number of walkers, specified by the user. The output is an image, which shows the walk for every walker in different
plots.

## Instructions to the user 

1. Clone the repository from Github 
2. Move to the cloned repository via the command line 
3. Specify the number of steps, the number of walkers and the name of the outputfile (as can be seen in the screenshot below) 
4. You need to call the script with python, writing: python walker.py ... 
5. For example: python walker.py 10 4 ./test_image.png

		10		= number of steps


		4		= number of walkers

		./test_image.pn = name of the outputfile
